Incoming president Rodrigo Duterte is ready to work with Congress to implement nationwide the curfew for minors, liquor ban, and no-smoking ordinances he has enforced as mayor of this city.
Iâ€™ll ask if I would need a national law If I have the authority under the broad police power of the state, maybe I can implement them, But if it is inadequate legally, I will ask Congress to pass a law, Duterte said in a press briefing Saturday night here.
Arleigh Sitoy, representative of District 6, sponsored the resolution strongly supporting the imposition of curfew for minors in the Philippines.
