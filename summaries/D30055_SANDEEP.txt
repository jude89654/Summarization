The latest threat to the government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi came after delegates to a two-day conference of the Communist Refounding Party voted to reject the government 's proposed 1999 budget, imperiling the future of the center-left coalition.
A leader of Italy 's hard-line Marxist faction, known as the Communist Refounding Party, resigned Monday in protest over his party 's decision to reject the government 's 1999 budget and imperil Prodi 's slender majority in Parliament.
There are more than 40 parties in Italy, and the government 's efforts to amend the constitution to introduce a two-party system failed.
