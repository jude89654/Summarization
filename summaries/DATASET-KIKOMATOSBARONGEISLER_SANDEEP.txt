The Philippine-based MMA company announced the matchup as a special exhibition on their Facebook account as the two seek closure to their feud, which began at a Quezon City bar on May 26 when Matos fired punches at Geisler during a confrontation, and culminated in Geisler challenging Matos to an MMA fight.
Baron Geisler and Kiko Matos have accepted the invitation of the Universal Reality Combat Championship URCC to settle their rift inside the cage.
Aguilar said one of the reasons he put up the URCC was to make sure that people have a proper venue to showcase their skills.
