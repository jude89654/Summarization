Offense There were signs in the ALCS that the offense is coming out of its collective slump Chuck Knoblauch is getting on base consistently, Derek Jeter is back to driving the ball to right field and through the middle, Bernie Williams had three hits in Game 6, and Scott Brosius has been a consistent force at the bottom of the lineup.
Nobody 's really taken advantage of the fact that Williams has a poor arm in center field, but rest assured that Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley and Greg Vaughn will try.
Ken Caminiti More power right-handed, a better hitter left-handed.
