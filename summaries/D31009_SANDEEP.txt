Ecevit, who served as prime minister three times in the 1970s, said he would immediately begin working to fashion a government that could command a majority in the faction-ridden Parliament.
Ecevit must now try to build a government that includes their center-right parties but not them as individuals.
Throughout the years, Ecevit, 73, has remained a strong defender of the cause of the Turkish Cypriots `` As long as Turkey lives, we wo n't allow the oppression and subordination of Turkish Cypriots at the hands of Greek Cypriots, '' he said in July 1997 during the 23rd anniversary celebrations of the invasion.
