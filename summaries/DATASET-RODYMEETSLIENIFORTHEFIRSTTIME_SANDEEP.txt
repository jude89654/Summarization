Finally, almost two months after President Rodrigo Duterte and Vice President Leni Robredo were elected into office, the two officials met for the first time in a warm encounter that betrayed none of the rumored distance between them.
Duterte and Robredo met Friday during the change of command ceremony at the AFP grandstand in Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City, and shook hands as soon as they saw each other.
They have yet to sit down to a formal meeting, but President Duterte broke the ice by offering Vice President Leni Robredo coconut juice during a brief encounter at Camp Aguinaldo yesterday.
