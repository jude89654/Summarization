Ramos-Horta had a rough time Wednesday night.
Eventually, the Foreign Ministry intervened and let Ramos-Horta enter Taiwan.
Ramos-Horta sought to play down the incident before leaving town Thursday.
Bent on revenge for earlier attacks on churches, mobs set fire to four mosques in West Timor Monday after a protest and strike by thousands of Christians degenerated into a riot, the military and a Muslim leader said.
The violence in the Christian-dominated city of Kupang was in retaliation for the burning and ransacking of 22 churches by Muslim mobs in the capital, Jakarta, on Nov. 22, when 14 people were killed.
