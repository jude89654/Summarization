In a decision, the Sandiganbayan Third Division said that the government prosecutors no longer raised any opposition on the previous motion filed by Corona�s camp to dismiss the existing charges of perjury and violation of the Code of Conduct against Corona following his death last April.
The cases stemmed from Corona�s alleged misdeclaration of assets in his Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth SALN) from 2001 to 2011.
But because of his untimely demise we are constrained to move for the dismissal of these cases on the ground that his death extinguishes his criminal and civil liabilities, he added.
