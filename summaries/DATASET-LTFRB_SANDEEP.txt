In an interview on GMA News TV 's News To Go, LTFRB chairperson Winston Ginez said they have given the drivers and operators enough time to upgrade their units in line with the modernization program of the board.
Sinabi namin noon na this will be implemented in school year 2015-2016, ï¿½ In 2015, the board extended the order to upgrade the units for one year due to the demand for extension.
Operators better think twice before staging a protest against the government order to phase-out school service vehicles that are more than 15 years old, a transport official warned on Monday.
