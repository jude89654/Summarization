For the second time this week, Jerry Ross and James Newman floated out the hatch of the shuttle Endeavour to work on the seven-story, 35-ton station taking shape in the open cargo bay.
Built by a Russian company and to be launched atop a Russian booster rocket, the 24-ton Zarya Sunrise control and cargo module is a U.S.-funded component of the station.
The unmanned launch, set for 9:40 Moscow time 0640 GMT Friday from Baikonur in Kazakhstan, has been delayed for one year mainly because of the cash-strapped Russian space agency 's failure to complete another part of the station.
