Relatives of the man who shot singer Christina Grimmie dead at a concert last night before killing himself have apologized for the murder in a note stuck to their front door.
This afternoon a hastily-scribbled note was found pinned to the door of his house, which he shares with his parents, which says Deepest sorrow for lost [sic to the family, friends and fans of the very talented, loving Christina Grimmie.
A publicist for Grimmie, Heather Walsh, said in an email early on Saturday that �we can confirm that Christina has passed and went home to be with the Lord�.
