Typhoon Butchoy brought heavy rains to several areas in Luzon and Metro Manila even after it made landfall in Taiwan early Friday.
Nepartak, as Butchoy is called internationally, was categorized as a super typhoon with 240 kph winds when it hit Taiwanâ€™s southeastern city of Taitung.
At least one died and 66 were injured, and up to 15,000 have been forced to evacuate, the Taiwan Central Emergency Operations Center said.
By 5 p.m. the typhoon has crossed Southern Taiwan and continues to move farther away from the Philippines, with maximum winds down to 150 kph and gusts of 185 kph.
