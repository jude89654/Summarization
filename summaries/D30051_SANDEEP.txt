The Serbian forces fighting here appear to have suffered unusually heavy losses and, after the guerrillas finally fled, took revenge against the civilians, shooting women and children at close range as they tried to run away from their pursuers.
`` Blood was in her mouth and her mother 's hand on the baby, '' said Imer Delijaj, the father, an avowed member of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic Albanian guerrilla force, who returned in uniform to discover the bodies.
I tried to clean the blood from her mouth and she put her tongue out. ''
Several members of the Delijaj clan survived.
