Opposition leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition figures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not negotiate freely in Cambodia and called for talks at Sihanouk's residence in Beijing.
I would like to make it clear that all meetings related to Cambodian affairs must be conducted in the Kingdom of Cambodia, Hun Sen told reporters after a Cabinet meeting on Friday.
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form a government on its own.
