In a statement yesterday, PLDT said the new logo reflects a fresh brand identity and shows the company ’s commitment to better serve customers who are using digital services more and more in their daily lives.
The release of new logo comes as the company is looking to change its name from “Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company ” to “PLDT Inc. ” to better represent the new direction being taken by the firm.
PLDT, the country 's once-dominant carrier, has been in the process of turning a new leaf as it sheds its traditional legacy telephony business toward more data-driven revenue models.
