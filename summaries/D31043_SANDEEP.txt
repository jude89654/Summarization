A Cabinet minister and a close Syria ally on Wednesday criticized the Syrian-backed choice of the army commander as president, and said he will boycott a vote to elect the military man for the executive post.
Walid Jumblatt, the minister for displaced persons, said he and his party 's three legislators will not vote when the 128-member Parliament elects the president, likely sometime before Oct. 23.
Although a boycott by Jumblatt 's Progressive Socialist Party will hardly spoil the chances of Gen. Emile Lahoud, it could embolden others to express discontent at the choice and the process of his election.
