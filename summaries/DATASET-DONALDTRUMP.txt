Donald Trump has revoked the Washington Post�s press credentials to his events, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee announced Monday.
�Based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign, we are hereby revoking the press credentials of the phony and dishonest Washington Post, � read a post on Trump�s Facebook page.
Trump repeated his assertion about Amazon and The Post � for which he has presented no evidence � in a brief press statement on Monday �We no longer feel compelled to work with a publication which has put its need for �clicks � above journalistic integrity, � the statement said.
