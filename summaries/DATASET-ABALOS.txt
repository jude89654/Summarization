The Sandiganbayan has acquitted former Commission on Elections Comelec) Chairman Benjamin Abalos Sr. of graft charges in connection with the botched $ 329-million National Broadband Network-ZTE Corp. NBN-ZTE contract in 2007.
Abalos was charged with graft for allegedly using his position in government to influence the outcome of the contract of the alleged anomalous NBN-ZTE transaction in exchange for commissions.
�All in all, the evidence only proved that accused was brokering the collaboration between AHI and ZTE, where ZTE would supply equipment to AHI while AHI would contract with the Philippine government for the operation of the NBN, � the decision said.
