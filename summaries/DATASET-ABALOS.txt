Abalos was charged with graft for allegedly using his position in government to influence the outcome of the contract of the alleged anomalous NBN-ZTE transaction in exchange for commissions.
He allegedly offered a P200-million �bribe� to former Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Romulo Neri in order to approve the deal, as well as Amsterdam Holdings Inc. AHI president Jose de Venecia III with $ 10 million for his firm to back out from the project.
The prosecution was only able to prove that Abalos brokered the deal between De Venecia and ZTE, not between the government and China �s ZTE, the court added.
