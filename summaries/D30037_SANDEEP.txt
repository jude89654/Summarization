Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Ariel Sharon, a hawkish former defense minister, to be Israeli foreign minister on Friday in an effort to placate the far right as he moves closer to turning over more West Bank land to the Palestinians.
Some professed to be aghast, and some, like Nabil Sha'ath, the Palestinian transportation minister, said they were willing to `` forget history '' if Sharon 's appointment provided Netanyahu the political backbone to sign a deal.
`` Appointing Sharon is a political step we like very much, '' said Shaul Yahalom, the minister of transportation and a leader of the National Religious Party.
