The Philippines on Tuesday, June 14, condemned the Abu Sayyaf 's “brutal and senseless ” murder of another Canadian hostage as it vowed to end the group ’s “reign of terror and banditry.
“It is with deep sadness that I have reason to believe that a Canadian citizen, Robert Hall, held hostage in the Philippines since September 21, 2015, has been killed by his captors, ” Trudeau said in a nationally televised address.
The Abu Sayyaf is believed to have just a few hundred armed followers but authorities regard it is as one of the most dangerous terrorist groups in the Philippines.
