When her photos went viral on the Internet, 13-year-old Rita Gaviola, a Badjao lass from the village of Barra here, was frightened by the amount of attention she received from netizens.
The Badjao Girl that has become a social media sensation is hoping that all the attention somehow helps her and her family climb out of poverty.
She also thanked Topher Quinto, the man who took her pictures at the Pahiyas Festival in Lucban, Quezon where she was begging for alms with her sibling.
