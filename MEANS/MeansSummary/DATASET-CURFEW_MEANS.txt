Incoming president Rodrigo Duterte is ready to work with Congress to implement nationwide the curfew for minors, liquor ban, and no-smoking ordinances he has enforced as mayor of this city.
Citing the need to restore public order and security, president-elect Rodrigo Duterte said he would impose a curfew on minors and would press local government units to stamp out noisy karaoke sessions.
The provincial board passed the local resolution supporting incoming President Rodrigo Duterte 's plan to impose the same restriction on minors nationwide.
