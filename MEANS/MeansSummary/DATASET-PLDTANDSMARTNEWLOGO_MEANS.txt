PLDT, the country 's once-dominant carrier, has been in the process of turning a new leaf as it sheds its traditional legacy telephony business toward more data-driven revenue models.
Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. PLDT yesterday unveiled its new logo in line with its move to go beyond its traditional businesses and shift focus to data-driven services.
The new logo symbolizes the powerful convergence of PLDT and Smart, combining fixed and wireless technologies to serve individual and enterprise customers, PLDT said in a press release.
