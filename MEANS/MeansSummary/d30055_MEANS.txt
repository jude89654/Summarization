Prodi had said he would call a confidence vote if the Communists yanked support.
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must now decide whether to call early elections or to ask Prodi or someone else to try to forge a new majority.
Italy 's Communists on Sunday voted to withdraw support for Premier Romano Prodi 's 2 1-2-year-old coalition, a move expected to trigger the collapse of one of the country 's longest-lived postwar governments.
The swing vote came from Prodi 's own coalition, a defecting deputy from Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini 's tiny Italian Renewal party.
