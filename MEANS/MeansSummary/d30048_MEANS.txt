The Commerce Department on Tuesday provided a concrete measure of the effects of the global economic downturn on the American economy, reporting that the nation 's trade deficit widened by $ 2.2 billion in August to $ 16.77 billion.
Leaders from 19 Latin American nations, Spain and Portugal put finishing touches Saturday on an Ibero-American summit declaration warning of global recession unless action is taken to stabilize the international financial system.
The draft declaration said recent financial market turmoil shows that adjustments must be made quickly `` to keep the difficulties affecting a few from becoming a crisis for all. ''
