A panel probing apartheid-era abuses has accused the African National Congress of human rights violations, including torture and bomb attacks, the state broadcaster said Monday.
Key figures implicated in human rights abuses by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission already are under investigation, the official, Jan d'Oliveira, told reporters.
They include two unnamed generals in the apartheid state 's security apparatus, President Nelson Mandela 's ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and officials of the African National Congress, he said.
