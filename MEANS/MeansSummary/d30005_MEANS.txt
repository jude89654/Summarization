On Aug. 20 the United States retaliated by firing Tomahawk missiles at suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan, killing 26 people.
According to U.S. intelligence sources, the camps were being used to train members of bin Laden 's al Qaeda terrorist group.
In an nearly simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam in neighboring Tanzania, 11 people were killed and 85 were injured, none of them Americans.
Under German law, U.S. officials have 40 days after the arrest to turn over supporting evidence so a German court can rule on their extradition request.
