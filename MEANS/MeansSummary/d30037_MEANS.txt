Ariel Sharon 's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves as `` the bullet of mercy '' for the Middle East peace process, an official Syrian newspaper said Saturday.
With his appointment, Sharon, 70, an ardent advocate for Jewish settlements in the West Bank, is expected to quell domestic opposition to the concessions that Netanyahu is supposedly prepared to make at a peace summit conference in the Washington area next week.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner in charge of negotiating Israel 's final borders with the Palestinians.
