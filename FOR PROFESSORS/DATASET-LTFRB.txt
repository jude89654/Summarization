The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Tuesday said it will not grant another extension to drivers and operators of 15-year-old school service units. 
In an interview on GMA News TV's News To Go, LTFRB chairperson Winston Ginez said they have given the drivers and operators enough time to upgrade their units in line with the modernization program of the board.
�Ito ay binaba namin noong 2014. Nagbigay kami ng phase out period para makapag-adjust muna sila at opportunity para makahanap ng financing. Sinabi namin noon na this will be implemented in school year 2015-2016,�
In 2015, the board extended the order to upgrade the units for one year due to the demand for extension.
�Kami ay pumayag provided na mag-execute sila ng affidavit of undertaking na by June 2016 ay may dapat na silang bagong sasakyan na compliant sa mga requirements natin,� he said. 
In 2004, the LTFRB issued the a Memorandum Circular enumerating the guidelines for School Transport Service Rationalization Program. 
The memorandum listed motor vehicles allowed for school transport services which include vans, jitneys, mini bus, and bus.
However in a memorandum released in 2015, the board excluded jitneys in the list of allowed motor vehicles and added front-facing seats as one of the specifications. 
The new memorandum also instructs the operators to secure a recommendation and endorsement from school administration and Parent-Teachers Association.
During the official start of classes this year, the board deployed inspection teams in various schools to check if the school service units have complied with the phaseout order. 
Among the schools inspected were the Batasan Elementary School, Diliman Preparatory, Marikina High School, Marist School and Lagro High School. 
The board is expected to inspect some others schools throughout the week. 
On Monday, school services paraded in front of the LTFRB office in Quezon City to protest the phaseout order. 
Commenting on this, Ginez said the board is firm not to grant another extension and not to allow 15-years-old units to operate. 
�Ipagpapatuloy na po namin �to, hindi na po kami bibigay by this year. At sana ganoon din ang susunod na board ng LTFRB na ipagpatuloy ang programa na ito,� he stressed.
Based on LTFRB rules, operators who will use phase-out units will be fined P200,000. The phase-out unit will also be impounded and the operator�s franchise may also be canceled. 
�Kapag ito ay ginamit parin nila, mismong mga authorities natin sa paaralan at mga Parent-Teachers association, ay kasama namin sila sa pagpapatupad nitong modernization para sa kapakanan at kaligtasan ng ating mga kabataan,� Ginez said.

Operators better think twice before staging a protest against the government order to phase-out school service vehicles that are more than 15 years old, a transport official warned on Monday.
Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Chairman Atty. Winston Ginez made the warning following plans of a school service vehicle group to greet the opening of classes with protests against the phase-out.
The National Alliance School Service Association of the Philippines (NASSAP) and Alliance of Concerned Transport Organizations (ACTO) last week threatened to boycott sending passengers to school unless the Board extends the memorandum on the phase-out.
To recall, NASSAP head Celso Dela Paz and ACTO head Efren De Luna were among the ones who pleaded with the LTFRB in 2015 to give them additional one year extension of the phase-out of school service units.
LTFRB agreed on the condition of the execution of Affidavit of Understanding by operators who will avail of extension that they will have brand new units come 2016.
The Board gave operators a 10-month transition period to assure the availability of school service for next school year. However, some operators have yet to fully comply with the memorandum.
"For De Luna and Dela Paz to claim now that they are not yet ready to comply with their undertaking is clear that they cannot be trusted. Simply put, they do not have a word of honor," Ginez said.
The LTFRB chief meanwhile said that the Board can easily cancel the franchises of operators who join the protest.
"The Board will exercise its full power to suspend or cancel franchises of PUV operators who will join them," he added.
Ginez meanwhile challenged Dela Paz and De Luna not to cover the plate numbers of their participating members when they stage their protest as it "shows cowardice."
He also urged the Land Transportation Office (LTO) to impose appropriate sanctions against PUVs who will participate in the protest.
Despite protests, Ginez maintained that the decision of the Board to phase-out school service vehicles more than 15 years old stays.

The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board  on Monday    ruled out any shortage of school bus units despite the phaseout of  units 15 years old and  above.
In an interview, Ariel Enrile Inton, one of the two LTFRB board members, allayed fears of the students and their parents of  inadequate number of school service vehicles.
�There can be no shortage. Of the 7,000 school bus units, only 1,000 of them have been phased out,� he told The Standard.
Apart from the compliance of many of the registered school bus operators, Enrile Inton said the application and issuance for a new franchise for the operation of such units is �open.�
�There are other people [operators] who can fill in the vacuum,� he added.
Operators and drivers of school service units, led by Alliance of Concerned Transport Organization president Efren de Luna, earlier claimed only 25 percent of the 7,000 school service units have complied with the phaseout of units 15 years old and above.
�We have obeyed the modernization program of the LTFRB to upgrade school bus units,� he told The Standard.
Yesterday, the group hit out LTFRB chairperson Winston Ginez for imposing  the phaseout policy.
While their other members have already purchased brand-new L300 Mitsubishi units to comply with the phaseout, Ginez wanted the European 4 emission standards.
Acto called on Ginez to grant another one-year moratorium.
�Here comes the summer [March], still the program has not yet been implemented,� Enrile Inton said.
In 2015, the LTFRB granted the school bus operators a 10-month moratorium until March 2016.
�The chairman fielded inspectors to different schools in Metro Manila to see if there is a shortage of school buses,� he said. �But there was none.�
