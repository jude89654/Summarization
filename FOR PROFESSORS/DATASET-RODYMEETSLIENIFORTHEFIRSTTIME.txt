Finally, almost two months after President Rodrigo Duterte and Vice President Leni Robredo were elected into office, the two officials met for the first time in a warm encounter that betrayed none of the rumored distance between them.
Duterte and Robredo met Friday during the change of command ceremony at the AFP grandstand in Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City, and shook hands as soon as they saw each other.
�It was OK, very cordial. I told him if I could set a courtesy visit as soon as possible and he said, anytime,� Robredo said, adding that her staff would make arrangements for one as soon as she gets back to her office.
The Vice President had been trying to snag a meeting with Duterte since they were proclaimed winners in the May 9 election, but his staff cited �conflicting schedules� for the much-delayed meetup.
The delay had led to speculations that the President was distancing himself from Robredo in light of his earlier statement about not giving her a Cabinet post because he did not want to hurt the feelings of former Sen. Bongbong Marcos, her closest rival in the tightly contested VP race.
Robredo led Marcos by a slim 200,000 margin.
The rumor about Duterte sidelining Robredo was fanned by the two officials� separate inauguration on June 30, with the President taking his oath of office at Rizal Hall in Malaca�ang, while the Vice President took it at her new office at the Executive House in New Manila, Quezon City.
Duterte�s spokespersons said the inauguration venue was too small to accommodate Robredo�s own share of guests.
But the meetup on Friday showed only warm interaction between the two, with the new Commander in Chief acknowledging the presence of his Vice President before his speech.
Duterte said he had wanted to sit beside Robredo, but that former acting AFP chief of staff Gen. Glorioso Miranda was seated between them, as protocol dictated.
The President was later seen offering his Vice President his coconut juice drink, which she smilingly declined.
Earlier Friday, the Office of the Vice President (OVP) issued a statement clarifying reports that had quoted the Vice President as saying that Mr. Duterte was �playing hard to get,� referring to the Inquirer headline on June 28.
�VP Leni did not say that,� the statement said.
Robredo was quoted as saying that her office had been trying to get an appointment with the President but that they had not found a date yet.  But she was not losing hope that she would finally meet with the President, the statement added.
The OVP said that Robredo was �open to go to the President, to talk with him, consult, and listen to his (policy) directions for the country.�
�The Vice President wholeheartedly supports our President,� the statement said.
Although Robredo was not at President Duterte�s inauguration, Marcos and his sister, Ilocos Norte Gov. Imee Marcos, were seen among the guests.
It was the first time that the children of the late dictator, Ferdinand Marcos, had set foot in Malaca�ang after they were chased into exile by the 1986 Edsa People Power Revolution.
Duterte yesterday installed Lt. Gen. Ricardo Visaya as the new AFP chief of staff, who will serve until he retires from the military service when he turns 56 in December, the mandatory retirement age in the uniformed service.
Miranda returns to his position as vice chief of staff.
Former President Benigno Aquino III appointed Miranda military chief in an acting capacity after then AFP chief of staff Lt. Gen. Hernando Iriberri retired in April, and an election appointments ban was in effect.

MANILA, Philippines - They have yet to sit down to a formal meeting, but President Duterte broke the ice by offering Vice President Leni Robredo coconut juice during a brief encounter at Camp Aguinaldo yesterday.
Duterte was about to drink the juice in tetra pack when he tried to give it to Robredo, only to hold back and sip it, to the laughter of the Vice President and the people around them.
In his speech, Duterte continued with his lighthearted banter as he acknowledged the presence of Robredo, saying, �This is my first time to meet you personally. I would have preferred to be seated beside you, but the defense (secretary, Delfin Lorenzana) is there.�
Robredo described her first meeting with Duterte as �very cordial.� The two highest officials of the land were both at the turnover of command ceremonies between the acting Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief, Lt. Gen. Glorioso Miranda, and incoming military chief, Lt. Gen. Ricardo Visaya at the military headquarters in Quezon City. 
Robredo shook hands with the President upon his arrival and again after Duterte finished his address to the troops, who accorded him full military honors as the new commander-in-chief.
Seated in the front row, the Vice President was between Lorenzana and Visaya, who was seated next to the President, Miranda and former president Fidel Ramos.
The meeting took place a day after the two took their oaths of office separately as the country�s President and Vice President, respectively.
Duterte was standard bearer of the PDP-Laban in the last May elections while Robredo was the Liberal Party�s candidate.
Robredo, who was all smiles after the meeting, said she asked Duterte if she could pay him a courtesy visit and the President replied, �anytime.�
Robredo and her camp have been seeking an official audience with the President but their requests have yet to be acted upon.
Earlier in the day, the camp of Robredo denied reports that the Vice President called Duterte �hard to get,� especially in setting up a meeting with her.
Special assistant to the President Christopher Go on Wednesday said Duterte and Robredo had been scheduled to meet last Friday but it did not push through.
Robredo was in Tokyo over the weekend upon the invitation of Philippine Ambassador to Japan Manuel Lopez for the National Day Celebration for the Filipino community there. 
Robredo was scheduled to go to her home province in Camarines Sur yesterday. 
According to her staff, Robredo, widow of the late interior secretary Jesse Robredo, was expected to take a bus to Naga City as she always did when she was still representative of the province�s third district. 
Her office has yet to release her activities in Naga as of yesterday afternoon.
Robredo said she was looking forward to meeting Duterte to personally assure him of her support. 
Duterte said earlier he was not keen on appointing Robredo to his Cabinet because of his friendship with former senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr., her closest rival in the vice presidential race.

It was a cordial first meeting between President Rodrigo Duterte and Vice President Leni Robredo, a day after they held separate inauguration ceremonies.
Before starting his speech at the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Change of Command on Friday, 71-year-old Duterte, the country's first septuagenarian president, acknowledged Robredo's presence and seemed pleased in meeting the former congresswoman.
"This is my first time to meet you personally, ma'am," Duterte told Robredo, who was also onstage, seated alongside military officials.
"I would have preferred to be seated beside you but andiyan si Defense [Secretary Delfin Lorenzana] eh," Duterte added, drawing laughter from the crowd.
A beaming Robredo responded with a nod. Prior to the program, the two were also seen shaking hands.
In an ambush interview after the ceremonies at Camp Aguinaldo, Robredo said she had a "very cordial" meeting with Duterte.
"Very cordial iyong meeting. Nagpaalam ako sa kaniya kung pwede ako magpaset ng scheduling, or courtesy visit. Sabi naman niya, anytime," Robredo said.
She said she will immediately work on setting the meeting.
This appears to have broken the ice between Duterte and Robredo, who ran for their respective posts under rival political parties.
Robredo was the administration Liberal Party bet who defeated Duterte's running mate, Senator Alan Peter Cayetano.
Duterte and Robredo were supposed to meet before the inauguration but the then-Vice President-elect's Japan trip supposedly got in the way, according to Duterte's aide de camp Bong Go.
Robredo, who had a separate inauguration in Quezon City, was also not invited to Duterte's inaugural ceremony at the Palace.
In May, Duterte said he would not appoint Robredo to a Cabinet position as he did not want his "friend" Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. to get hurt.
