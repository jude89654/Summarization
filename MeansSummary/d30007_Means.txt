Fighting for the town of Kindu in this vast West African nation subsided after rebels launched an artillery barrage into government-held buildings and the airfield, two miles three kilometers away.
Sweaty and weary, some limping and others bandaged, they waited to be airlifted to a hospital in Goma, the rebel stronghold 380 kilometers 235 miles east, on the Rwandan border.
A Congo Airlines executive said the victims were civilians being evacuated from Kindu, about 1,000 kilometers 620 miles east of the capital, Kinshasa.
The rebels have targeted Kindu since late August, when they were forced to retreat from the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa, after troops from Angola and Zimbabwe came to Kabila 's aid.
`` Kindu is effectively in the hands of the FAC, which has now launched an offensive after defending its positions, '' said a ministry statement broadcast on state-run television.
