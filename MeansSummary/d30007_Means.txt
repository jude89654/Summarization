Fighting for the town of Kindu in this vast West African nation subsided after rebels launched an artillery barrage into government-held buildings and the airfield, two miles three kilometers away.
Rebels said the airplane was carrying 40 troops and ammunition.
`` Kindu is effectively in the hands of the FAC, which has now launched an offensive after defending its positions, '' said a ministry statement broadcast on state-run television.
On Aug. 2, Tutsis, political opponents, and disenchanted members of President Laurent Kabila 's army took up arms, accusing Kabila of corruption, nepotism and fostering tribal strife.
Apart from Kindu, Ngangura said rebel fighters took Buta, 120 kilometers 75 miles north of Kisangani and on the main road in northern Congo that links Sudan and the Central African Republic.
