Thai police have detained more than 300 beggars, most from neighboring countries, in a campaign to make Bangkok 's streets safer for spectators and athletes arriving for the upcoming Asian Games, a senior police officer said Friday.
Horses belonging to Iran 's equestrian team will not be allowed to compete in next month 's Asian Games because they failed to meet the requirements of the games veterinary commission, the Thai organizers announced Thursday.
The three horses originally came from Iran, but arrived in Thailand after a training period in the United States.
They did not have the necessary health certificates guaranteeing that they are disease-free, said Siraya Chunekamrai, president of the Veterinary Commission for the games.
