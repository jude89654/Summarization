A key witness in the government 's sexual misconduct case against Malaysia 's former deputy prime minister remains determined to appeal his conviction, his attorney said Monday.
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday he is not too choosy about who will be his successor.
Bruises on the face of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim, splashed on newspaper front pages for two days and downloaded from the Internet, are blemishing the image of Malaysian police.
Munawar Ahmad Aness, a friend and speech writer of Anwar Ibrahim, pleaded guilty to the charges last month, allegedly confessing to having sex with the political dissident.
The man need not necessarily be very religious and only preoccupied with doing virtuous deeds at all times, the national news agency, Bernama, quoted Mahathir as saying after Friday prayers at the Al-Falah Mosque in the northern town of Jitra in Kedah state.
