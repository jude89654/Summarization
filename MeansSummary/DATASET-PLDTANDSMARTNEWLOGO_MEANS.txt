Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. PLDT yesterday unveiled its new logo in line with its move to go beyond its traditional businesses and shift focus to data-driven services.
PLDT and its wireless unit Smart Communications have both overhauled their company logos in keeping with their ongoing shift to reinforce their digital business.
“The new logo symbolizes the powerful convergence of PLDT and Smart, combining fixed and wireless technologies to serve individual and enterprise customers, ” PLDT said in a press release.
The only difference between the two new logos is the colorway.
PLDT added that the fresh brand identity reflects desire to empower customers who are increasingly embracing digital services in daily lives.
“Rather than allow ourselves to be disrupted by new technologies, we are disrupting ourselves.
“We shall lead the digital revolution by embracing the smart life within the organization, pursuing digital innovations and enabling our customers to go digital in their own ways.
This year, PLDT is expecting profits of P28 billion, down from P35.2 billion last year as the company plays catch-up in the digital space.
