The fund Kuchma proposed to establish would have accumulated money in a special National Bank account and repay people in case the bank they kept their savings in went bankrupt or became insolvent.
Ukraine 's parliament on Friday refused to approve President Leonid Kuchma 's decree establishing a state fund to compensate people for savings lost in banks.
Deputies voted 240-47 to prepare a revised version of the decree and debate it later in the month.
They must consider the decree by Oct. 10, or else it automatically takes effect under the constitution.
Leftist factions, which voted against the proposed legislation, said it would not fully guarantee the return of savings lost during the financial instability that has recently hit Ukraine.
