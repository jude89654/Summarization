De La Salle University’s Lady Spikers have reclaimed its throne in the UAAP women’s volleyball division, ending the two-year reign of Ateneo de Manila University’s Lady Eagles on Saturday afternoon April 30, 2016 in a do-or-die game held at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.
The La Salle Lady Spikers took home their ninth championship trophy of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines UAAP women’s volleyball tournament after getting the better of rivals the Ateneo Lady Eagles, 19-25, 25-21, 25-16, 25-16, on Saturday April 30 at the SMART Araneta Coliseum.
With a 19-25, 25-21, 25-16, and 25-16 record, the Lady Spikers emerged victorious against the defending champion.
Kim Kianna Dy paced the Lady Spikers with 17 markers, while MaJoy Baron chipped in with 11.
La Salle dominated Ateneo in 2012 and 2013 before Ateneo turned the tide in 2014 and 2015.
But the Ateneo Lady Eagles clawed their way back to draw level at 19-all.
The run proved to be short-lived as the Lady Spikers stopped the bleeding and walked away with set 2, 25-21.
Unlike Game 2, there was no more spectacular comeback from Ateneo, who trailed by as much as 21-9 in the fourth set.
