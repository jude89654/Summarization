A badly wounded aide to a murdered lawmaker regained consciousness Monday and was talking to police, who later arrested several suspects in raids around the city, officials said.
Mourners bearing flowers and candles gathered Sunday outside the house on Griboyedova Canal where a Russian legislator, Galina Staravoitova, was shot to death on Friday night.
Two thugs, armed with machine pistols and silencers, stalked and killed a powerful figure, then slipped away into the night.
