The Spanish and British governments appeared Wednesday to be seeking shelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain.
A delegation of Chilean legislators lobbying against the possible extradition of Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial, warned Thursday that Chile was on the brink of political turmoil.
The wife of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet appealed for his release, saying he is too sick to be extradited to Spain to face charges of genocide.
`` Despite everything that has been written, this is not a decision for the British government or the Spanish government, '' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said in an interview published by a Spanish newspaper on Wednesday.
Britain has defended its arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, with one lawmaker saying that Chile 's claim that the former Chilean dictator has diplomatic immunity is ridiculous.
