Leading maxi yachts Brindabella, Sayonara and Marchioness were locked in a three-way duel down the New South Wales state coast Saturday as the Sydney to Hobart fleet faced deteriorating weather.
Two sailors died and 15 others were missing after gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race Monday.
`` There are two that have been confirmed deceased which is tragedy because in the 54-year history of the race I think there 's only two people who have died in it before, '' said Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman David Gray.
The two dead were found on the 40-foot 12-meter vessel Business Post Naiad, about 60 miles 100 kilometers off the New South Wales town of Merimbula, according to the Australian Search and Rescue Coordination Center in Canberra.
