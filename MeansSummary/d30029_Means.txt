United States maxi Sayonara looks set to continue the foreign domination of line honors in Australia 's famous Sydney to Hobart yacht race, which starts Saturday.
Leading maxi yachts Brindabella, Sayonara and Marchioness were locked in a three-way duel down the New South Wales state coast Saturday as the Sydney to Hobart fleet faced deteriorating weather.
All three maxis reported in at the same latitude during Saturday night 's positioning report when they were about 30 nautical miles south of Jervis Bay on the New South Wales south coast.
The two dead were found on the 40-foot 12-meter vessel Business Post Naiad, about 60 miles 100 kilometers off the New South Wales town of Merimbula, according to the Australian Search and Rescue Coordination Center in Canberra.
Morning Glory, a German maxi, broke the 21-year-old race record two years ago, arriving in Hobart 2 days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds after she left Sydney.
