Metro Manila CNN Philippines — Typhoon Butchoy brought heavy rains to several areas in Luzon and Metro Manila even after it made landfall in Taiwan early Friday.
But even if Butchoy is already outside PAR and it did not make landfall in the Philippines, it continues to enhance the southwest monsoon.
Nepartak, as Butchoy is called internationally, was categorized as a super typhoon with 240 kph winds when it hit Taiwan’s southeastern city of Taitung.
For the rest of Friday and also on Saturday, July 9, expect monsoon rains in Metro Manila, Cavite, Laguna, Zambales, Bataan, Batangas, Pangasinan, Calamian Group of Islands, and Mindoro.
By 5 p.m. the typhoon has crossed Southern Taiwan and continues to move farther away from the Philippines, with maximum winds down to 150 kph and gusts of 185 kph.
The Visayas and the rest of Luzon will also have occasional rains, while Mindanao will have isolated rainshowers or thunderstorms.
It was forecast to move northwest toward China at 12 kph, according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration PAGASA.
The typhoon enhanced the southwest monsoon and dumped heavy rains over the northwestern part of the country, causing floods in Zambales and Bataan.
