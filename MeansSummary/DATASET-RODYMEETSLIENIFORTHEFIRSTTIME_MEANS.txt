MANILA, Philippines They have yet to sit down to a formal meeting, but President Duterte broke the ice by offering Vice President Leni Robredo coconut juice during a brief encounter at Camp Aguinaldo yesterday.
Duterte and Robredo met Friday during the change of command ceremony at the AFP grandstand in Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City, and shook hands as soon as they saw each other.
In his speech, Duterte continued with his lighthearted banter as he acknowledged the presence of Robredo, saying, �This is my first time to meet you personally.
I would have preferred to be seated beside you, but the defense secretary, Delfin Lorenzana is there. �
The rumor about Duterte sidelining Robredo was fanned by the two officials � separate inauguration on June 30, with the President taking his oath of office at Rizal Hall in Malaca�ang, while the Vice President took it at her new office at the Executive House in New Manila, Quezon City.
�VP Leni did not say that, � the statement said.
Robredo was scheduled to go to her home province in Camarines Sur yesterday.
Although Robredo was not at President Duterte�s inauguration, Marcos and his sister, Ilocos Norte Gov. Imee Marcos, were seen among the guests.
