Donald Trump has revoked the Washington Post�s press credentials to his events, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee announced Monday.
Smith said he believes the ban stems from an unflattering profile of Trump that BuzzFeed published in 2014.
The fact is, The Washington Post is being used by the owners of Amazon as their political lobbyist so that they don�t have to pay taxes and don�t get sued for monopolistic tendencies that have led to the destruction of department stores and the retail industry. �
The newspaper changed it on its own, before Trump�s complaint.
�Based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign, we are hereby revoking the press credentials of the phony and dishonest Washington Post, � he wrote in a Facebook post.
