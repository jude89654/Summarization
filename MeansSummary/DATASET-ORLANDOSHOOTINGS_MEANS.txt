Labeling it a hate crime, the Catholic Bishops ’ Conference of the Philippines CBCP denounced the deadly attack that killed 50 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.
President Barack Obama will travel to Orlando on Thursday to pay respects to the victims of last weekend ’s nightclub shooting and to stand in solidarity with the community as it embarks on recovery, the White House said Monday night.
“ While we may have reasons to disagree with sexual preferences, or reprove certain forms of sexual activity, this can never justify hatred, let alone, murder of another human being, ” CBCP president Lingayen-Dagupan Archbishop Socrates Villegas said in a statement Monday evening, June 13.
Obama had canceled what was to be his first campaign event with presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the wake of the shooting at a gay nightclub that killed 49 and wounded dozens more.
Mateen performed the minor umrah pilgrimage for 10 days in March 2011 and again for eight days in March 2012, the ministry spokesman told AFP.
Obama has called the Orlando shooting an act of terrorism and an act of hate.
Earlier Monday, Obama said the gunman was inspired by extremist information over the internet, calling it an apparent example of “homegrown extremism ” that US officials have been worrying about for years.
“At this stage, we see no clear evidence that he was directed externally, ” Obama said, referring to suggestions that the Islamic State group or other extremists had orchestrated the attack.
