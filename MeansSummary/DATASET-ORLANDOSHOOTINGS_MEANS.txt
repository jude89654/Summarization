Labeling it a hate crime, the Catholic Bishops ’ Conference of the Philippines CBCP denounced the deadly attack that killed 50 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.
Obama had canceled what was to be his first campaign event with presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the wake of the shooting at a gay nightclub that killed 49 and wounded dozens more.
“ While we may have reasons to disagree with sexual preferences, or reprove certain forms of sexual activity, this can never justify hatred, let alone, murder of another human being, ” CBCP president Lingayen-Dagupan Archbishop Socrates Villegas said in a statement Monday evening, June 13.
Villegas explained that this was a hate crime because this was “the murder of persons because of disgust for their sexual orientation. ”
