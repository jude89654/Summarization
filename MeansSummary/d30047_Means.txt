Russia 's Zarya, or Sunrise, module is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting module.
The two station pieces are so big 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds that Currie and her crewmates were going to have to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views, rather than direct line of sight.
The station, involving 16 nations with the United States and Russia playing the biggest roles, will consist of more than 100 elements that will take 45 assembly flights to complete.
Other spacewalking chores for Ross and Newman on Wednesday evening included erecting a sunshade over a computer mounted to the outside of Unity.
