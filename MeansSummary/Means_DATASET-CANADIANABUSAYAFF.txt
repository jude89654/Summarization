An Abu Sayyaf spokesperson, shortly after the ransom deadline lapsed, said Canadian Robert Hall has been executed.
“We strongly condemn the brutal and senseless murder of Mr Robert Hall, a Canadian national, after being held captive by the Abu Sayyaf group in Sulu for the past 9 months.
Abu Sayyaf gangs have earned many millions of dollars from kidnapping foreigners and Filipinos since the early 1990s.
Rather, he said, Canada will continue to work with allies and the Philippines “to pursue those responsible for these heinous acts and bring them to justice, however long it takes. ”
From 2002-2014, the US deployed Special Forces advisers to train and provide intelligence to Filipino troops, which led to the killing or arrest of many Abu Sayyaf leaders.
