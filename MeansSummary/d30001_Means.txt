Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Friday rejected opposition parties demands for talks outside the country, accusing them of trying to `` internationalize '' the political crisis.
Cambodia 's ruling party responded Tuesday to criticisms of its leader in the U.S. Congress with a lengthy defense of strongman Hun Sen's human rights record.
King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia 's top two political parties previously bitter rivals to form a coalition government led by strongman Hun Sen. In a short letter sent to news agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People 's Party in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government.
Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party opposition had called on the monarch to lead top-level talks, but disagreed on its location.
Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence.
