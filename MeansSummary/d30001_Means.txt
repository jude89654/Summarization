King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia 's top two political parties previously bitter rivals to form a coalition government led by strongman Hun Sen. In a short letter sent to news agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People 's Party in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government.
Disputes over the presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People 's Party to form a new government.
Uncompromising enemies just a few months ago, Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC President Prince Norodom Ranariddh agreed Nov. 13 to form a government at a summit convened by Sihanouk.
`` The protocol on cooperation between the CPP and FUNCINPEC will certainly bring peace and progress to our nation and people, '' Sihanouk wrote.
