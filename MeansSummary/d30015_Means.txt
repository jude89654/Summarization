The United States and Russia are ratcheting up the pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless he takes decisive action soon to end the humanitarian crisis in the southern Serbian province.
With the threat of NATO attack mounting, Yugoslavia 's prime minister warned Monday the nation faces the `` imminent danger of war '' and claimed the government is taking steps to comply with international demands for peace in Kosovo.
BRUSSELS, Belgium AP U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said Monday the military situation in Kosovo was as bad now as two weeks ago.
Milosevic was also told, the diplomats said, that he had to insure that the roughly 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who have been forced to flee their homes in the fighting in the last six months be allowed to return home.
