Shares of Mobil, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, rose $ 7.625, or 9.7 percent, to $ 86.
Shares of Exxon, the biggest U.S. oil company, rose $ 1.6875, or 2.3 percent, to $ 74.375.
The merger discussions come against a backdrop of particularly severe pressure on Lucio Noto, the chairman, president and chief executive of Mobil, to find new reserves of oil and natural gas and to keep big projects profitable at a time of a deep decline in crude oil prices.
The boards of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. are expected to meet Tuesday to consider a possible merger agreement that would form the world 's largest oil company, a source close to the negotiations said Friday.
Exxon and Mobil, the nation 's two largest oil companies, confirmed Friday that they were discussing a possible merger, and antitrust lawyers, industry analysts and government officials predicted that any deal would require the sale of important large pieces of such a new corporate behemoth.
