Shares of Mobil, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, rose $ 7.625, or 9.7 percent, to $ 86.
Shares of Exxon, the biggest U.S. oil company, rose $ 1.6875, or 2.3 percent, to $ 74.375.
News that Exxon and Mobil, two giants in the energy patch, were in merger talks last week is the biggest sign yet that corporate marriages are back in vogue.
The merger discussions come against a backdrop of particularly severe pressure on Lucio Noto, the chairman, president and chief executive of Mobil, to find new reserves of oil and natural gas and to keep big projects profitable at a time of a deep decline in crude oil prices.
Exxon and Mobil, the nation 's two largest oil companies, confirmed Friday that they were discussing a possible merger, and antitrust lawyers, industry analysts and government officials predicted that any deal would require the sale of important large pieces of such a new corporate behemoth.
