Shares of Mobil, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, rose $ 7.625, or 9.7 percent, to $ 86.
News that Exxon and Mobil, two giants in the energy patch, were in merger talks last week is the biggest sign yet that corporate marriages are back in vogue.
The merger discussions come against a backdrop of particularly severe pressure on Lucio Noto, the chairman, president and chief executive of Mobil, to find new reserves of oil and natural gas and to keep big projects profitable at a time of a deep decline in crude oil prices.
Shares of Exxon, the biggest U.S. oil company, rose $ 1.6875, or 2.3 percent, to $ 74.375.
The boards of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. are expected to meet Tuesday to consider a possible merger agreement that would form the world 's largest oil company, a source close to the negotiations said Friday.
