The Badjao Girl that has become a social media sensation is hoping that all the attention somehow helps her and her family climb out of poverty.
When her photos went viral on the Internet, 13-year-old Rita Gaviola, a Badjao lass from the village of Barra here, was frightened by the amount of attention she received from netizens.
A Badjao teen has been overwhelmed with the attention she has been receiving after a photograph of her begging for spare change during a local festival in Lucban, Quezon went viral online.
Rita Gabriola, 13, thanked netizens who made her pictures go viral for their generous compliments on her looks.
The photo, posted on Facebook last May 14 by photographer Topher Quinto Burgos, showed 13-year-old Rita Gaviola begging with her younger sister at the Pahiyas Festival.
I thought I would be arrested by the police for begging, ‚Äù said Gaviola, who admitted she was computer illiterate and knew nothing about Facebook and social media.
Masaya lang po ako at nagpapasalamat ako kay Kuya Topher, ako po ang napili niya.
Kapatid nating mga Badjao na may angkin ganda.
