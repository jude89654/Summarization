The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 10 Just days before heading to the United States for critical negotiations with Palestinian leaders, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu jolted the Middle East peace effort with the appointment of Ariel Sharon as Israeli foreign minister.
Ariel Sharon, the hawkish former general tipped to be Israel 's next foreign minister, said in an interview published Sunday that if he gets the job, he wo n't shake the hand of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
The most optimistic reading is that Sharon, long an implacable foe of the Palestinians, is prepared to make peace with them and then sell it to the Israelis who are most opposed.
`` It is time to deliver, '' Saeb Erekat told reporters Sunday night after a meeting of the Palestinian Cabinet.
Sharon, who opposes ceding West Bank land to the Palestinians, is being considered for the government 's No. 2 post.
