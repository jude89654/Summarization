Ariel Sharon 's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves as `` the bullet of mercy '' for the Middle East peace process, an official Syrian newspaper said Saturday.
In Beirut, Lebanese newspapers denounced the appointment as a `` disaster '' for peace.
Both his friends and foes would agree that the new foreign minister is not a natural diplomat.
Palestinians also were expressing growing unease over the naming of hawkish former Israeli general Ariel Sharon as Netanyahu 's foreign minister.
