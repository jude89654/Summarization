The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 10 Just days before heading to the United States for critical negotiations with Palestinian leaders, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu jolted the Middle East peace effort with the appointment of Ariel Sharon as Israeli foreign minister.
Ariel Sharon 's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves as `` the bullet of mercy '' for the Middle East peace process, an official Syrian newspaper said Saturday.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Ariel Sharon, a hawkish former defense minister, to be Israeli foreign minister on Friday in an effort to placate the far right as he moves closer to turning over more West Bank land to the Palestinians.
Ariel Sharon 's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves as `` the bullet of mercy '' for the Middle East peace process, an official Syrian newspaper said Saturday.
The most optimistic reading is that Sharon, long an implacable foe of the Palestinians, is prepared to make peace with them and then sell it to the Israelis who are most opposed.
