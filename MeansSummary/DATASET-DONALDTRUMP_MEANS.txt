Donald Trump has revoked the Washington Post�s press credentials to his events, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee announced Monday.
Donald Trump said Monday that he is pulling The Washington Post�s credentials to cover his events because he is upset with the newspaper�s coverage of his campaign.
�Based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign, we are hereby revoking the press credentials of the phony and dishonest Washington Post, � he wrote in a Facebook post.
The move puts the newspaper on a long list of media outlets that the presumptive Republican nominee has banned for reporting that displeased him.
The Post�s executive editor Martin Baron said in a statement, �Donald Trump�s decision to revoke The Washington Post�s press credentials is nothing less than a repudiation of the role of a free and independent press.
When coverage does n�t correspond to what the candidate wants it to be, then a news organization is banished.
The Post will continue to cover Donald Trump as it has all along�honorably, honestly, accurately, energetically, and unflinchingly.
We�re proud of our coverage, and we�re going to keep at it. �
