Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte and Camarines Sur Rep. Leni Robredo have emerged as winners of the May 9 national elections after the National Board of Canvassers finished counting certificates of canvass on Friday.
Rodrigo Duterte, the tough-talking Davao City mayor, won the May 9 presidential election by a landslide against four other prominent officials according to the official congressional canvass of votes late Friday.
Based on the final official tally, Duterte won the presidential race with 16,601,997 votes while Robredo led the vice presidential race with 14,418,817 votes.
He won the ballots of nearly 40 percent of 44 million voters, lured by his success against crime in Davao, despite the questions his policies raised among human rights campaigners.
