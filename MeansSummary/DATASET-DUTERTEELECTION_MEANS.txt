Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte and Camarines Sur Rep. Leni Robredo have emerged as winners of the May 9 national elections after the National Board of Canvassers finished counting certificates of canvass on Friday.
Rodrigo Duterte, the tough-talking Davao City mayor, won the May 9 presidential election by a landslide against four other prominent officials according to the official congressional canvass of votes late Friday.
Based on the final official tally, Duterte won the presidential race with 16,601,997 votes while Robredo led the vice presidential race with 14,418,817 votes.
I hereby proclaim Rodrigo Roa Duterte and Maria Leonor Gerona Robredo as the duly elected president and vice president of the Republic of the Philippines, Senator Franklin Drilon and Congressman Feliciano Belmonte said in a joint session of Congress.
The canvassing of the votes took three days to finish, amid complaints by the camp of Sen. Ferdinand Marcos Jr. who came in at close second behind Robredo.
Sen. Koko Pimentel, sitting as the co-chair of the canvassing board, said the House of Representatives and the Senate will resume their joint session at 2 p.m. on Monday, where Duterte and Robredo will be proclaimed as the president and vice president-elect, respectively.
He won the ballots of nearly 40 percent of 44 million voters, lured by his success against crime in Davao, despite the questions his policies raised among human rights campaigners.
