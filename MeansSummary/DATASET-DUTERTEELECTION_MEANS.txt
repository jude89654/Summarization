Rodrigo Duterte became the 16th president of the Philippines on Monday when a joint session of Congress declared him winner of a May 9 election, succeeding Benigno Aquino who steps down next month after six years in office.
I hereby proclaim Rodrigo Roa Duterte and Maria Leonor Gerona Robredo as the duly elected president and vice president of the Republic of the Philippines, Senator Franklin Drilon and Congressman Feliciano Belmonte said in a joint session of Congress.
Camarines Sur Rep. Leni Robredo, widow of Interior secretary Jesse Robredo and first-term congresswoman, won the tight vice presidential race.
He won the ballots of nearly 40 percent of 44 million voters, lured by his success against crime in Davao, despite the questions his policies raised among human rights campaigners.
