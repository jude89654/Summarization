TUNIS, Tunisia AP U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan left for Libya Saturday to hold talks aimed at putting two suspects on trial for the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie.
Libya 's justice minister on Wednesday said the two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner should not become victims of Western politics when they go on trial.
`` We want to be sure that the only aim of the trial is to show the truth ... and that it is held without a political or security background, '' Justice Minister Mohammed Belgasim al-Zuwiy said.
He was addressing the General People 's Congress, or Parliament, which opened a debate that will decide the fate of the two men who are wanted in connection with the Dec. 21, 1988 bombing.
During his visit to Tunis, Annan is to meet with authorities here to discuss `` major regional and international issues and the various initiatives aimed at solving unresolved problems, '' according to the local press.
