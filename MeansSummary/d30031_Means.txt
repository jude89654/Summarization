A last-minute alarm forced NASA to halt Thursday 's launching of the space shuttle Endeavour, on a mission to start assembling the international space station.
For the second day in a row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour on Friday for liftoff on NASA 's first space station construction flight.
While putting the new station closer to Russia 's 12-year-old Mir station would make it easier to transfer equipment and supplies from the old outpost to the new one, the request came too late to be acted on, said Randy Brinkley, NASA 's space station program manager.
NASA was surprised last week when Russia 's prime station contractor proposed the orbital position change just two-and-a-half weeks before launch of the first part of the new station.
This was the first time in three years, and 19 flights, that a shuttle countdown had been stopped after the spaceship was fueled and the crew aboard the craft and ready to go.
