The planet 's most daring construction job began Friday as the shuttle Endeavour carried into orbit six astronauts and the first U.S.-built part of an international space station that is expected to cost more than $ 100 billion.
For the second day in a row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour on Friday for liftoff on NASA 's first space station construction flight.
The master alarm blared and red lights flashed just before the shuttle was to lift off early Thursday.
While putting the new station closer to Russia 's 12-year-old Mir station would make it easier to transfer equipment and supplies from the old outpost to the new one, the request came too late to be acted on, said Randy Brinkley, NASA 's space station program manager.
After a last-minute alarm on the shuttle forced a postponement early Thursday, the launch went off flawlessly at 3:36 Friday morning, right on schedule.
