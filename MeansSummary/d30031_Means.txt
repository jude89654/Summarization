Following a series of intricate maneuvers and the skillful use of the space shuttle Endeavour 's robot arm, astronauts on Sunday joined the first two of many segments that will form the international space station.
Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle.
After a last-minute alarm on the shuttle forced a postponement early Thursday, the launch went off flawlessly at 3:36 Friday morning, right on schedule.
While putting the new station closer to Russia 's 12-year-old Mir station would make it easier to transfer equipment and supplies from the old outpost to the new one, the request came too late to be acted on, said Randy Brinkley, NASA 's space station program manager.
