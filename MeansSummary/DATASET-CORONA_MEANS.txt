THE anti-graft court junked on Wednesday the pending criminal cases filed against the late Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona.
The Sandiganbayan on Wednesday dismissed the perjury and violation of the code of conduct cases against the late Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona on the ground of his death.
In a decision, the Sandiganbayan Third Division said that the government prosecutors no longer raised any opposition on the previous motion filed by Corona�s camp to dismiss the existing charges of perjury and violation of the Code of Conduct against Corona following his death last April.
In a hearing before the Sandiganbayan Third Division, the prosecution panel no longer raised any objection on the motion of Corona�s legal team to dismiss eight counts of perjury under the Revised Penal Code RPC and another eight counts of violation of Republic Act 6713 or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees filed by the Office of the Ombudsman against the former magistrate in April 2014.
