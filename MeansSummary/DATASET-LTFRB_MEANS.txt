The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board LTFRB on Tuesday said it will not grant another extension to drivers and operators of 15-year-old school service units.
Operators better think twice before staging a protest against the government order to phase-out school service vehicles that are more than 15 years old, a transport official warned on Monday.
In an interview on GMA News TV 's News To Go, LTFRB chairperson Winston Ginez said they have given the drivers and operators enough time to upgrade their units in line with the modernization program of the board.
Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board LTFRB Chairman Atty.
Nagbigay kami ng phase out period para makapag-adjust muna sila at opportunity para makahanap ng financing.
Sinabi namin noon na this will be implemented in school year 2015-2016, ï¿½ In 2015, the board extended the order to upgrade the units for one year due to the demand for extension.
In 2004, the LTFRB issued the a Memorandum Circular enumerating the guidelines for School Transport Service Rationalization Program.
Among the schools inspected were the Batasan Elementary School, Diliman Preparatory, Marikina High School, Marist School and Lagro High School.
