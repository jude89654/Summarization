Operators better think twice before staging a protest against the government order to phase-out school service vehicles that are more than 15 years old, a transport official warned on Monday.
Winston Ginez made the warning following plans of a school service vehicle group to greet the opening of classes with protests against the phase-out.
The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board LTFRB on Tuesday said it will not grant another extension to drivers and operators of 15-year-old school service units.
In an interview on GMA News TV 's News To Go, LTFRB chairperson Winston Ginez said they have given the drivers and operators enough time to upgrade their units in line with the modernization program of the board.
