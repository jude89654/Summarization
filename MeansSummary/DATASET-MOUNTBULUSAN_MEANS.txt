Laguerta narrated that today’s phreatic explosion is the 2nd after the phreatic explosion last February 22.
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology Phivolcs has allayed fears that a major eruption in Mount Bulusan is imminent following the steam-driven explosion that happened on Friday morning.
Renato Solidum of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology Phivolcs said in a phone interview that the eruption was “phreatic” which produced a grayish ash plume that drifted to the western side of the volcano.
Solidum explained that the recent activity – caused by the conversion of ground water to steam – is common in the volcano considered as among the most active in the country.
In the past 24 hours, Phivolcs has recorded 113 quakes around Mount Bulusan.
He said the phreatic explosion was clearly seen due to fair weather with the height of 2 kilometers high of thick grayish to white clouds.
Hydrothermal processes are ongoing beneath the volcano that may lead further steam-driven eruptions.
“Residents outside the 4-kilometer area are safe, but must prepare for possible ashfall, ” he added.
