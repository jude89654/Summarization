Laguerta narrated that today’s phreatic explosion is the 2nd after the phreatic explosion last February 22.
Renato Solidum of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology Phivolcs said in a phone interview that the eruption was “phreatic” which produced a grayish ash plume that drifted to the western side of the volcano.
Solidum explained that the recent activity – caused by the conversion of ground water to steam – is common in the volcano considered as among the most active in the country.
Mount Bulusan in Sorsogon province spewed a 2-kilometer ash column around 11:35 a.m., Friday.
