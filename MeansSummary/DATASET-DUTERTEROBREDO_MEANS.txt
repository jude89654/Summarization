Senate President Franklin Drilon and House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. made the proclamation at 4:10 p.m., close to an hour after the joint session started.
Duterte skipped the proclamation ceremonies with his executive assistant Bong Go saying that the president-elect was busy with his �chores � as outgoing Davao City mayor.
Duterte topped the official tally of Congress, sitting as National Board of Canvassers, with 16,601,997 votes, while Robredo got 14,418,817 votes.
Duterte, who had been meeting well-wishers, possible appointees, politicians, and foreign envoys in Davao City since he was presumed the winner, earlier said that he would not attend the proclamation rites.
Duterte will be the country 's 16th president, while Robredo will be the 14th vice president.
Before going to the House of Representatives in Quezon City, Robredo attended a thanksgiving Mass at St. Peter Parish along Commonwealth Avenue.
As she awaited her proclamation, Robredo took the usual spot where she sat as Representative of Camarines Sur during plenary sessions.
Di�o�s candidacy, however, kept the door open for a partymate like Duterte to become a substitute candidate.
