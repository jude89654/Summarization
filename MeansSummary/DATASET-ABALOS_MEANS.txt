Shortly after the Sandiganbayan absolved him on Wednesday of graft over the scuttled $ 329-million national broadband network NBN project with China �s ZTE Corp. during the Arroyo administration, former Commission on Elections Comelec) chair Benjamin Abalos Jr. immediately proceeded to Wack Wack Golf and Country Club in Mandaluyong City.
The Sandiganbayan has acquitted former Commission on Elections Comelec) Chairman Benjamin Abalos Sr. of graft charges in connection with the botched $ 329-million National Broadband Network-ZTE Corp. NBN-ZTE contract in 2007.
Abalos was charged with graft for allegedly using his position in government to influence the outcome of the contract of the alleged anomalous NBN-ZTE transaction in exchange for commissions.
This was the golf course where Abalos allegedly offered P200 million in �commission � to then National Economic and Development Authority Chief Romulo Neri in exchange for endorsing the NBN deal in April 2007.
He allegedly offered a P200-million �bribe� to former Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Romulo Neri in order to approve the deal, as well as Amsterdam Holdings Inc. AHI president Jose de Venecia III with $ 10 million for his firm to back out from the project.
More than nine years later, the antigraft court�s Fourth Division said government prosecutors failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Abalos had indeed acted as agent in behalf of ZTE to secure the lucrative contract.
�Accused Benjamin Abalos is acquitted of charge against him for failure of the prosecution to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt, � the anti-graft court�s Fourth Division said in its 43-page decision.
�It�s time to move on, � the 81-year-old Abalos told reporters after the court acquitted him.
