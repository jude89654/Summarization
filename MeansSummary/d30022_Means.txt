Protesting the lack of a defense lawyer, the father of a prominent dissident is to seek a delay in his son 's subversion trial, scheduled to start on Thursday in the central city of Wuhan.
It appears to be finished, although the court did not announce a decision or say when it would.
In a telephone interview Wednesday evening, his father, Qin Qinguo, 76, said that before the trial begins, he plans to hand the court a written plea for postponement.
But in this case, the elder Qin said, some lawyers he approached declined to take the case, while others were warned by security officials not to get involved.
Almost 200 dissidents signed a letter to the Chinese government protesting the detentions, said the Information Center for Human Rights and Democratic Movement in Hong Kong.
