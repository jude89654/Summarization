The first substantive talks in more than two months between opposing sides of the National Basketball Association 's labor dispute came and went Thursday without a hint of a settlement.
As labor battles go, the current one between the National Basketball Association and its players is weird even by sports standards.
Still, a five-hour meeting that was described as cordial by the league and `` almost like two bulls letting off a little steam '' by the players association produced another scheduled round of talks next Tuesday.
Barring a major compromise, that will not be enough time to preserve a full season and prevent the league from losing its first regular-season games to labor strife in November.
He also discussed the possibility of a significantly shortened season.
