The meeting took place a day after the two took their oaths of office separately as the country �s President and Vice President, respectively.
Although Robredo was not at President Duterte�s inauguration, Marcos and his sister, Ilocos Norte Gov. Imee Marcos, were seen among the guests.
Duterte yesterday installed Lt. Gen. Ricardo Visaya as the new AFP chief of staff, who will serve until he retires from the military service when he turns 56 in December, the mandatory retirement age in the uniformed service.
The rumor about Duterte sidelining Robredo was fanned by the two officials � separate inauguration on June 30, with the President taking his oath of office at Rizal Hall in Malaca�ang, while the Vice President took it at her new office at the Executive House in New Manila, Quezon City.
But the meetup on Friday showed only warm interaction between the two, with the new Commander in Chief acknowledging the presence of his Vice President before his speech.
