Senate President Franklin Drilon and House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. made the proclamation at 4:10 p.m., close to an hour after the joint session started.
Congress on Monday afternoon proclaimed Davao City Mayor Rodrigo �Rody � Duterte and Camarines Sur Representative Maria Leonor �Leni� Robredo as the next president and vice president of the country, respectively.
The proclamation came after Congress, sitting as the National Board of Canvassers, finished the canvassing of votes with Duterte officially winning the presidential elections with 16,601,997, and Robredo, the vice presidential polls with 14,418,817.
Duterte was a mile ahead of his closest pursuer, administration candidate Mar Roxas, who had more than nine million votes.
