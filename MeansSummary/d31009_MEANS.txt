A week after the Turkish government fell in a corruption scandal, President Suleyman Demirel on Wednesday asked a veteran left-wing politician known for his personal honesty, Bulent Ecevit, to form a new government.
President Suleyman Demirel appeared likely to turn to some widely trusted lawmaker to form Turkey 's next government, after a veteran politician abandoned efforts Monday to persuade bickering political leaders to support him in a pro-secular coalition.
After failing to bring together political rivals in a coalition, Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit announced Saturday that he was returning his mandate to the Turkish president.
The military, self-appointed guardians of Turkey 's secular system, is adamantly opposed to the inclusion of Islamic Virtue, the largest party in parliament.
Parliament convened Thursday to vote on whether to move toward a no-confidence motion that could bring down the government over an organized crime scandal.
